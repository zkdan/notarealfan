<h1>Root for the Minnesota Timberwolves!</h1>

	<p class="TIM summary">This is the only option. The Wolves consistently field an adequate team of nearly 5 men ( often 4 men and a young Spanish boy with a teen pop star's name) (Ricky Rubio)(Rubio means blond in Spanish) (Ricky is not blond). They used to have a couple of good huge white guys and as an apology for how bad they were last season, the league let them have a first round draft pick this year. Andrew Wiggins is a literal child, but somehow he's supposed to carry this team? Jesus did more at a younger age, and, hey, 'tis the season.</p>
