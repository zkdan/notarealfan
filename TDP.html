	Seriously, bud. Whatever you want. Now, I'm not saying you have to root for the Spurs, or even watch basketball. We wouldn't want to impose, but, heck, if you enjoy the way we play the game, well, there's nothing wrong with sitting down to a nice big plate of hardwood. We'd be honored to have your eyes and ears for as long as you're willing to give them to us. 
	Love, Tim
